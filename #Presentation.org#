Before study we need to know little understand vedic cosmology and vedic astrology and jothisya sastra  need to know about 

kali Yuga started just over approx 5,000 years ago in 3102 and 3113 B.C.E BCE   when Krishna left our planet Earth which was calculated by famous scholars 
There are two estimation that is 0th Kali-yuga is either 
- 3042 BC or   
- 3102 BC. by aryabhada, astrologers
Present Kali yuga year is (3102BCE +2021AC= 5124 kaliyuga)  (3042 + 2021= 5063 kaliyuga)
Kali Yuga, the fourth age in a cycle, lasts for 
- 432,000 (human-solar) years 
- 1,200 divine years  (1 divine year = 360 solar (human) year or 6-cycles samvatsar

Kali-yuga consist of 3 parts 
- *Part-I* : *kali-yuga-sandhya* (dawn)       [3102BC-32,899CE]  36,000 solar year or   100 divine years
- *Part-II* : *kali-yuga*                   [32,899CE-392,899CE] 360,000 solar year or 1,000 divine years
- *Part-III* : *kali-yuga-sandhyams* (dusk) [392,899CE-428,899CE]  36,000 solar year or  1000 divine yearsa

Presently we are in part- I of kali yugam 
** Start of Kaliyuga by aryabhada ~= 3102 BC
- 3102 BC. by aryabhada, astrologers https://www.thegaudiyatreasuresofbengal.com/2021/04/11/beginning-date-of-kali-yuga-start/
Aryabhatta written that he was 23 years old when 3600 years of KaliYuga has passed. Since Aryabhatta born saka 398 or 476 AD, the starting of Kali-yuga ~ 3012BC
476 birth + 23 age = 499AC = 3600 AK
499 AC + Start_Kaliyuga = 3600
Start_Kaliyuga =~ 3101 BC

https://www.booksfact.com/puranas/kali-yuga-timeline-started-on-24-january-3102-bce.html

Sri Krishna was shot by an arrow of a hunter on his feet on the thursday evening of 23rd January 3102 BCE.
He left his physical body on 24th January 3102 BCE at 02 hours 27 minutes 30 seconds.
The next sunrise was on Friday, with moon in Aswini Nakshatra, tithi (lunar day) being Suddha Padyami (sukla pratipad or first day of lunar month) of Chaitra Maasam (lunar month) in Pramādi named year(13th of 60 year cycle).

If Kaliyuga is started in 1st year of 60-year cycle which is Prabhava    then   
Prabhava :  3113BC, 3053BC,  2993BC,  

** Start of Kaliyuga by indian independence <= 3053 BC
after 5000 years of kaliyuga
one lady will rule 14 years
ram ram ram will rule the india
prajal le raju i yeru
rajanu ane darmaha will be gone and pajanue ane darnaha : all kings will be gone and people will rule the country.
narasimha will rule the country (pv narasimha rao)

So we can understand that all this happend after independence 15th Aug 1947 so
1947 AD < 5000 AK
1947 + Start of Kaliyuga < 5000
Start of Kaliyuga  < 3053 BC 
** Estimate start of kaliyuga from kalagnana prophecies - Case 1:  Start of Kaliyuga < 3077BC
- In 5098  Kaliyuga to   price of rice is 2 grains per rupee  https://youtu.be/FD0VQ0Jo_NU?t=2304
  - Assume start of kaliyuga 3012BC or 3113BC then  
    - 5098 −3102= 1996 : if we assume that start of kaliyuga  is at 3102BC then  in 1996(5098 kaliyuga) price of rice should be Rs 1/  per 2 grains which is false according to data:
    - 5098 -3113=1985 : which is wrong estimate  then start of kaliyuga    
  - Assume in future price of rice is increase to 2grain per rupee
    - Estimate : 2021 + Start_Kaliyuga < 5098 then Start of Kaliyuga < 3077BC

- if assume there a 60 year life cycle difference then bc should be  estimate start of kaliyuga 3102 - 60 = 3042 BC
    - then 5098 kaliyuga will be (2056 + 3042)= 5098  which support  above prophecies
** Estimate start of kaliyuga from kalagnana prophecies - Case 2: Start of Kaliyuga < 3097BC
-  End of  5118 Kaliyuga year the entire world only 1/7 of population will be survied  https://www.youtube.com/embed/G68ngdKd7gU?start=766

Wrong Estimate  5118 -3102 = 2016 which didn't happen but it can happen in future
Estimate : 2021 + Start_Kaliyuga < 5118 then Start of Kaliyuga < 3097 BC

- If Start of Kaliyuga is 3102 -60 = 3042BC

Approximate : 5118-3042 = 2072 

** Estimate start of kaliyuga from kalagnana prophecies - Case III: Start of Kaliyuga < 3058 BC or ( 3058 -n*60) BC
- From Eashwara Naam Samvatsar to end of Vikrama Naam Samavatsaras  1 out of 7 villages and 1 out of 7 houses will survive  
  - Vikrama 	1880, 1940, 2000, 2060
- In  end of 5118 kaliyuga 1/7 world population will survive there is other prophecies
- (start of kaliyuga) + 2060 + n*60 <= 5118  = = > star of kaliyuga <= 3058 -n*60 BC
** Estimate start of kaliyuga from kalagnana prophecies - Case IV: Start of Kaliyuga < 3046- n*60 BC
- From Bhahudhanya Naam Samvatsaras : next 14 years there will be many catastopies seviour drouth and floods., bload bath,and seviour wars will happen, and many destructions will  occure.
  - Bhahudhanya 1878, 1938, 1998, 2058
  - Estimate (2058-2072)  
- End of 5118 of kaliyuga and 1/7 population survived
- For both prediction
  - Assume  after catastopies(2072AC) then at 5118 Kaliyuga world population will be 1/7  then
    2072+ n*60 + Start_Kaliyuga < 5118
    Start_Kaliyuga < 3046 -n*60 BC
-  start of kaliyuga 5118-2072 = 3046BC (which aprroximate over assuption but for perfect  match we need to see at 3046 BC is Prabhava nama samvatsar which is wrong)
  
- Assume that  kaliyuga start at 3042BC then 5118 kaliyuga (2076) then  which match that 3032BC is Prabhaba nama samvatsar 
   - From Estimate 2058-2072 pralays and war can happen
   - by 2076 world population will be 1/7 which satisfies both

- In these palace for  Rs 1/- price for rice is  2 grains(seeds) (price of rice will increase)
- Estimate start of kaliyuga from kalagnana prophecies: 


- In 5098  Kaliyuga to   price of rice is 2 grains per rupee 
  - (5098 −3000 = 2098 : rougf estimate so  
  - Assume start of kaliyuga 3012BC then  
    - 5098 −3102= 1996 : if we assume that start of kaliyuga  is at 3102BC then  in 1996(5098 kaliyuga) price of rice should be Rs 1/  per 2 grains which is false 
  - if assume there a 60 year life cycle difference then bc should be  estimate start of kaliyuga 3102 - 60 = 3042 BC
    - then 5098 kaliyuga will be (2056 + 3042)  which support  above prophecies

    - start of kaliyuga 5118-2072 = 3046BC
  - Assume that  kaliyuga start at 3042BC then 5118 kaliyuga (2076) then 
   - From Estimate 2058-2072 pralays and war can happen
   - by 2076 world population will be 1/7 which satisfies both

* Orissa Jagannath Temple Predictions  Bavisya-Malika

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXOie84pffI
orisa pridiction
Odia literature was largely enriched by the contributions of the five saints (Panchasakha). They were Jagannath Das, Balaram Das, Achyutanda Das, Yasovanta Das and Sisu Ananta Das. Pancha Sakhas were the collective name for the famous five Saints or five Friends. Balaram Das, Jagannath Das, Achyutananda Das, Ananta Das, and Jasobanta Das were five saints who emerged in the sixteenth century. Shri Achyutananda Das was the most prolific writer of the Panchasakhas and has written numerous books classified under categories such as Pothi, Mālika, Tika, Gita etc.,

believed not in one life but in many successive lives. He is known as the Mahapurusha, which means - a great man. Jagannath Das, Balaram Das, Achyutanda Das, Yasovanta Das and Ananta Das. Jagannath Das and Shri Chaitanya were contemporaries. As per their narration, towards the end of Mahabharat when Lord Krishna was leaving his mortal body, Nilakantheswara Mahadeva appeared & told him that the Lord's companions Dama, Sudama, Srivatsa, Subala, and Subahu would reincarnate in the Kali-yuga & be known as Ananta, Acyutananda, Jagannatha, Balarama and Yasovanta, respectively. Mahapurusha Achyuta had established various spiritual energetic centers called Gadi. Panchasakhas are compared with Nostradamus for predicting future events.

L. De l'aquatique triplicité naistra, D'vn qui fera le Ieudy pour sa feste: Son bruit, loz, regne, sa puissance croistra, Par terre & mer aux Oriens tempeste.
=From the three water signs will be born a man who will celbrate Thursday as his holiday. His renown, praise, rule and power will grow on land and sea, bringing trouble to the East.=

LI. Vn Duc cupide son ennemy ensuyure, Dans entrera empeschant la phalange, Hastez à pied si pres viendront poursuyure, Que la iournee conflite pres de Gange.
=A Duke eager to follow his enemy Will enter within impeding the phalanx: Hurried on foot they will come to pursue so closely That the day will see a conflict near Ganges.=

LXXV. Tant attendu ne reuiendra iamais, Dedans l'Europe en Asie apparoistra: Vn de la ligue yssu du grand Hermes, Et sur tous Roys des Orients croistra.
=Long awaited he will never return In Europe, he will appear in Asia: One of the league issued from the great Hermes, And he will grow over all the Kings of the East.=

LXXVI. Le grand Senat discernera la pompe, A l'vn qu'apres sera vaincu chassé: Ses adherans seront à son de trompe Biens publiez, ennemis dechassez. The great Senate will ordain the triumph For one who afterwards will be vanquished, driven out: At the sound of the trumpet of his adherents there will be Put up for sale their possessions, enemies expelled. LXXVII. Trente adherans de l'ordre des quirettes Bannis, leurs biens donnez ses aduersaires: Tous leurs bienfaits seront pour demerites, Classe espargie deliurez aux Corsaires. Thirty adherents of the order of "Quirites" Banished, their possessions given their adversaries: All their benefits will be taken as misdeeds, Fleet dispersed, delivered to the Corsairs.
