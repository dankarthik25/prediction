PREFACE
Hafiz Muhammad Sarwar Nizami’s
(Edited with best of Intentions)
</p>

<p>
My friends,
The above-mentioned words of God means that Indeed the friends of Allah are neither in fear nor in grief.
Fear results from not knowing the future and grief results from what happened in one’s past… The glory of the friends of Allah is that neither they feel grief on past events nor are they afraid of the future because when they become friends of Allah, Allah becomes a friend of them.
</p>

<p>
… Difference between Wali and Walayat should be kept in mind. Walayat (Sainthood) is a position, a station that is assigned to a Wali (Saint). i.e. Wali has his own existence and Walayat has its own existence. Take an example of Ilm (knowledge) and A’alim (Scholar). A’alim is the one who has been given the knowledge. Similar is the relation in Nabuvat (Prophet hood) and Nabi (Prophet). Prophet is the one who has been assigned the station of Prophet hood.
</p>

<p>
Now please note the difference in the status / knowledge of Prophet hood and Sainthood.
</p>

<p>
Prophet (PBUM) said:
I’ve come to known whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earths (worlds). I.e. I see the universe as I see my palm.
Whereas, Walayat said: Syedna Abdul-Qadir Jillani R.A said: I see the universe as I see a grain of rice on my palm.
</p>

<p>
Difference in both statements should be noted. The sayings of Prophet hood are like a plain palm whereas the sayings of Sainthood are like a grain on palm. When a grain of rice is placed on a palm, one dimension (down) out of six dimensions (left, right, front, back, up and down) is invisible to the eyes. Whereas, there is no dimension hidden on plain palm. Thus, where Sainthood reaches its top point (means where Sainthood reaches to top limit), there begins the Prophet hood. Similarly, where materialism reaches its top point (means where materialism reaches to top limit), there starts the Roohaniat (Spiritualism)
Let’s ponder over the knowledge of Allah who is infinite and whose attributes are infinite. It is not possible that God who is infinite has limited attributes or God who is limited has infinite attributes.
</p>

<p>
God knows everything from the beginning. For Him everything is already known (Ma’loom – in information). Ilm (Knowledge) comes later. That is why friends of Allah say that Ma’loom is superior to Ilm. For a man, Ilm comes first and Ma’loom is secondary. For Allah, Ma’loom comes first and Ilm comes later.
</p>

<p>
Sheikh Akbar Muhayudin Al-Arabi states that information of Allah that were originated from the Nafs (soul?) of Allah granted knowledge to Allah. Because Allah is infinite, unique, One, unlimited and is not dependent on anyone, therefore He himself is A’alim. All Knowledge, All Information (whatever is there to know) and the Knower, all that 3 levels, belong to Allah who is infinite.
</p>

<p>
Holy Hadeeth is:
</p>

<p>
(In the beginning) There was nothing besides Allah. So when there was nothing with him (in the beginning), therefore there is nothing with him (now)… that is when there was nothing and only Allah existed, he knew everything. To him, there was nothing that was hidden (or unknown). He was Aleem (an attribute, meaning knower); he is Aleem and will remain Aleem. There is no restriction of past, present and future… neither he is bound by Time nor by space. (Similarly) his attributes are neither bound by time nor by space.
</p>

<p>
Allah says in Al-Quran:
Indeed Allah encompasses everything with Ilm.
</p>

<p>
His knowledge is pure and without any medium or source. Man through medium knows the knowledge of Smoke and Fire. By seeing the smoke, knowledge of man informs the man that there is a fire there. The existence of smoke denotes the existence of fire i.e. the knowledge of Fire is gained through the medium of smoke. Knowledge of Allah is pure and without a medium.
My friends,
</p>

<p>
Allah says in Quran:
We have stated everything openly. In Lohe-Mahfooz (The Tablet. The Akashic Records)
</p>

<p>
And Prophet Muhammad S.A.W (PBUH) said that Allah Ordered the Pen:
O Pen! Write down everything that is known to me and whatever is going to happen till the Day of Judgment. Allah ordered and the Pen obeyed.
</p>

<p>
Imam Hussain R.A. Said in “Meerat-ul-Aa’rifeen”:
All praise to Allah who extracted (Ilm) from “Noon” (an alphabet) and wrote it in (through) the mouth of Pen.
</p>

<p>
Allah says in Al-Quran:
Let’s understand it. Ink is the status of knowledge where all the information is hidden or a status where all alphabets, words, sayings and whatever is said is hidden but cannot be separated and everything is already known to the Self of God (or the soul of God) even the level of ink itself. Then all those information was described through the mouth of the pen and all those information were saved and separated in sentences.
</p>

<p>
That is why we see in Hadeeth:
The first ever creation was my Noor (light). First ever creation was the Pen. First ever creation was the intellect (wisdom or intelligence).
</p>

<p>
All three levels, stations and attributes belong to one personality. i.e. Hazrat Muhammad S.A.W.
Allah took all three levels and swore that O Muhammad S.A.W., I sware of the station when you were at level of Ink, and I sware of the station when you were at the level of the Pen and I sware of the station when you were at the level of Sentence.
</p>

<p>
Note: Alphabets, Words, and what was said all three are located in a sentence.
</p>

<p>
Allama Iqbal said (Bal-e-Jibreel Poem: Read complete Poem Zauq-o-Shauq ):
</p>

<p>
Allah said:
We have openly described everything in Lohe-Mahfooz (Tablet, Akashic Record)
</p>

<p>
Jalaludin Rumi R.A. Said:
Lohe-Mahfooz is in front of friends of Allah (Walis). Whatever is written there is pure and without error.
Naimutullah Shah Wali r.a. was a great Wali of Allah. Knowledge of Jaffar (Alphabets, words, numerology) was his slave. It is a small miracle that 800-year-old predicted events are happening to the letter. Some sources suggest that he wrote more than 2000 poetic stanzas out of which the translator/author has 248 stanzas. Some stanzas are incomplete and singular.
</p>

<p>
He traveled through many cities to reach Kashmir. There, he passed away.
</p>

<p>
He said:
Lord Curzon (Viceroy) banned this prediction stating: how it is possible that we only rule India for 100 years?
The stanzas of qaseeda are very rare now. The lovers of Awliya protected the stanzas. It is saved in manuscripts, and in memory.
</p>

<p>
Author thought about publishing the qaseeda for a long time. Now with the help of Man Ali Hassan, it will be published and the reader will enjoy it.
</p>

Humayun will run to the land of Iran, to the bloodline of the prophet so that they can honor humayun. The Iranian King will help Humayun so that Humayun can be honored as a King. By the time Humayun will attack India again, SherShah will be dead and his son will be ruling the land.(6)</li>
<li>So Humayun will conquer India. Then will come Akbar as the King of the land.(7)</li>

The war with West Pakistan started on December 3, 1971, resulted into destruction and chaos in Pakistan. Yahya Khan’s incompetence and careless resulted into the loss of The Eastern Province and about 100,000 soldiers became POWs. About 1.5Million Bengali and non-Bengali were killed. Before that time, for 23 years, Islam and Muslims were safe and sound in this part of the world.

Saudi Arab, Libya, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Jordan, and all other Middle Eastern Muslims will help Pakistan. People of knowledge categorize mankind into four classes. Aryans, Mongols, Ethiopians and Europeans. European people are white in complexion. Ethiopians are black. Aryans are people of Indo-pak and Middle East. Mongols are people from Indonesia and China. China is located in the north of Pakistan. China and Pakistan are considered friendly nations. For this reason, maybe Shah Naimatullah Wali is indicating Chinese nation as Mongols. Such help is to come after the 10 Zil-Hujj. We can assume that the equipment of war will arrive during Muharram. – Hafiz Nizami

Allah has a system for ‘unseen’ as well. ‘Unseen’ is unseen and in the knowledge of Allah alone until Allah let it to be seen and known. Whatever Allah commands, it appears on the Lohe-Mahfooz (The Preserved tablet or Akashic records). Those who have the ability and permission can view it. Some can see the commands for one day, some for a week, some for a month, some for a year and some can view, as much as Allah wants them to.

NOTES
                           By Hafiz Muhammad Sarwar Nizami’s
Respected Elders,
In the above-mentioned Qaseeda (poetic story), Naimat-ullah Shah Wali R.A. used “May Beenam” as radeef. It means, “I am Looking at”. According to the knowledge of Sarf, its masdar is “Deedan”. “Deed” is its past tense and “baind” is its mazar’a. Because “May Beend” shows the present tense so when used as singular Mutakalam, it will become “May Beenam”. He’s a friend of Allah and is stating that “I am, looking at”.
‘To see’ is of two types. One is to see through physical eyes, the other is through inner spiritual eyes.
</p>

<p>
Maulana Ghulam Rasool Alampur Kotly r.a. Said:
Close these physical eyes that cannot do justice Open your inner eyes for salvation.
Page-31
</p>

<p>
‘To see’ from the physical eyes is to look through physical senses. ‘To see’ through spiritual eyes is to look through power of vision. The name of this power is ‘thought’. Thought process is of two types. One is a limited and the other is absolute. Limited thought is associated with physical me whereas absolute thought is beyond me. Everything that we see in our world is of high density. Sufi termed it as ‘the realm of bodies’. Whatever is present in the realms of bodies, all of it is present in the ‘realm of shapes’. However, all of the ‘realm of shapes’ cannot be present in the ‘realm of bodies’. Because in its expansion, this ‘realm of bodies’ to ‘realm of shapes’ is like a drop of water in an ocean.
</p>

<p>
Beyond ‘realm of shapes’ is the ‘realm of soul’. In its expansion, the ‘realm of shapes’ to the ‘realm of soul’ is like a ring in a large land. So, in order to understand, take ‘realm of shapes’ as a ‘burzakh’ (purgatory) in between the ‘realm of soul’ and ‘realm of bodies’ or take it as a veil.
</p>

<p>
Realm of soul is the first level of the divine reality. It is a collective level. All shapes and forms are contained in it. All shapes are vague (without specific gender, without full form). Contrary to this, in the realm of shapes, all shapes are present in detailed forms. But these shapes or forms are of very light density.
Page-32
</p>

<p>
So when the limited thoughts are purified i.e. when Nafs (self) and heart is purified, then the third eye is able to view the shapes of lighter density. It means that when the reflection of such shapes is put on the mirror of bound imagination, then the events of the future are seen and predictions can be made that a certain event can happen at a certain time. Its example is same as of Sun, clouds and earth. If clouds come in between the sun and the earth, then the sunlight cannot reach the earth. The clouds are the burzakh in between the sun and the earth. If clouds are not present, then the sunlight will come down and light the earth.
</p>

<p>
… To summarize, if the bound astral body is purified, then the lower density shapes and forms which are present in the realm of shapes, will en-light one’s heart and the seeker will then be able to see the future and will have the power to understand the divine knowledge and will have the power to observe.
</p>

<p>
Naimat Shah Wali was one of the greatest saints and a friend of Allah. For this reason, he was granted the knowledge of ‘unseen’.
Page-33
</p>

<p>
He used ‘May Beenam’ in the above-mentioned Qaseeda. The understanding of divine wisdom and power to observe starts in the realm of shapes i.e. realm of moot but his levels/stations are far higher than this. He had the access to the realm of jabroot and lahoot.
</p>

<p>
Maulana Jalal-ud-din Roomi r.a. Said:
When the mirror of your heart will be clean and purified Then you will witness all shapes through water or dust

(39) Points(111-121): Mogals (Mughals) ruled India and some other nations for a long time and then their empire vanished. Their children were killed and the English invaders destroyed their families and virtues. British East India co. entered in India in the guise of traders. Slowly, they bribed the officials to get more and more access and power. Then they formed their own Castles and their own army and started invading different cities and states. Finally in 1857, they got hold of the throne of India. England ruled India for approx. 100 years. In those hundred years, the western knowledge replaced Indian sciences. Rajas/Maharajas ruled in more than 50 states. All of them lost their kingdom. – MC

<h3 id="org4d47b1a"><span class="section-number-3">4.3</span> 60 year samvatsar cycles</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
These 60 Samvatsaras repeats in a cycle of 12 years. The significator of the year is Shani, Saturn, which takes approximately 30 years to complete the entire twelve signs of the zodiac.
The yugas of periods began when both Jupiter and Saturn were at 0-degree of Aries. 
So, if we take the lowest common multiple between the motion of Jupiter and Saturn (approximately 12 years and 30 years), we get the count of 60.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, every 60 years, both Jupiter and Saturn reach the 0-degree of Aries, and this interplay between both the planets, the angles formed, the influences that arise due to the combination, significantly affect the Samvatsaras and the individuals.
</p>

<p>
The sixty Samvatsaras (Prabhava to Kshaya) are divided into three groups of 20 Samvatsaras,
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>first group of 20 Samvatsaras (Prabhava to Vyaya) is assigned to Lord Brahma,</li>
<li>the next group of 20 Samvatsaras (Sarvajit to Parabhava) to Lord Vishnu,</li>
<li>the last 20 (Plavanga to Kshaya) to Lord Shiva.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There is other difference in vedic calander based on 
earth wobble movement :earth axis or north-pole does not matches druva nakshatra and it complete once circle for every 26,000 years

Samvatsaras: The Meaning &amp; Its Importance in Vedic Astrology
Date: April 9, 2021 Author: Clickastro
hindu calendar
Lord Prajapati or Brahma is known to be the embodiment of Samvatsara that is widely used to explore a different segment of time like day, ritus (seasons), Ayana, and Month masa.
</p>

<p>
The term “Samvatsara” is a Sanskrit word for ‘year’ in the Vedic literature. It roughly means a period of one full year sidereal when the Sun enters the sign of Aries. Some astrologers define it as the time in which Brihaspati (planet Jupiter) with its average speed crosses the journey of one zodiac sign and moves on to the next. According to this definition, when Jupiter completes the entire circle of traversing all 12 zodiac signs, it comprises 12 Samvatsaras. During the entire journey, Jupiter is either close by or far from planet Earth based on which it creates positive or negative influences for an individual.
</p>

<p>
The Hindu calendar has a cycle of 60 years and is named from Prabhava to Kshaya. Generally, the new Hindu year begins at the end of April every year. In the current cycle, the year Prabhava coincides with the Christian year 1987.
</p>

<p>
indepth horoscope
These 60 Samvatsaras repeats in a cycle of 12 years. The significator of the year is Shani, Saturn, which takes approximately 30 years to complete the entire twelve signs of the zodiac. The yugas of periods began when both Jupiter and Saturn were at 0-degree of Aries. So, if we take the lowest common multiple between the motion of Jupiter and Saturn (approximately 12 years and 30 years), we get the count of 60.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, every 60 years, both Jupiter and Saturn reach the 0-degree of Aries, and this interplay between both the planets, the angles formed, the influences that arise due to the combination, significantly affect the Samvatsaras and the individuals.

The sixty Samvatsaras (Prabhava to Kshaya) are divided into three groups of 20 Samvatsaras each wherein the first group of 20 Samvatsaras (Prabhava to Vyaya) is assigned to Lord Brahma, the next group of 20 Samvatsaras (Sarvajit to Parabhava) to Lord Vishnu, and the last 20 (Plavanga to Kshaya) to Lord Shiva.

The Samvatsara for this year is known as Sharvari (also called Zarvari or Sarvari). Each Samvatsara carries a particular essence that is correlated with its Sanskrit name along with its group ruler. The Samvatsara for this 2020-2021 year is the fourth in a group of five years ruled by the Manes.
</p>

<p>
career horoscope
The Manes are of two types: and are the children of Lord Brahma, also known as the Prajatis, who’re great rishis, progenitors, and protectors of the planet Earth, the animal kingdom, and the entire human race. Often called “Ancestors”, they inhabit their region between the realms of the human race (mankind) and the Gods, a place known as “Pitraloka”.
</p>

<p>
The word Sharvari means “night or twilight” or “pernicious or murderous” depending on the context with which we look at it. However, if we go by the ancestral predictions, this year is known to bring famine and trouble and that we are already seeing in the form of COVID-19 virus outbreak across the globe or in the form of locust plague spread out in parts of Africa. So, it won’t be wrong to say that the current five-year cycle ruled by the Manes (2017 – 2022) is challenging and a period of calamity for the human race.
</p>

<p>
Even in the last Sharvari cycle (during 1960) the human race experienced a similar case without the outbreak of the Great Chinese famine from 1959 – 1961.

Kalagnanam was written in Telugu Language and ‘Sandra Sindhu Veda’ on palm leaves, and Sri Veera Brahmendra Swamy’s sayings and ballads are being sung by wandering minstrels and mendicants. 
They are in the oral tradition. Most of his predictions have come true and rest is yet to come true. 
It is stated that Kalagnanam of the entire World contains 3,32,000 volumes. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A small part of Kalagnanam is available in Brahmamgari Matham at Kandimallayapalle, Siddhayyagari Matham at Mudumala, Rangarajugari Matham at Nagaripadu,</li>
<li>and the remaining major part is kept in the inner pit of Banaganapalle Mutt under tamarind sprout which has grown into a big tree now.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Sri Veera Brahmendra Swamy wrote in his Kalagnanam that he was incarnation of Lord Vishnu and 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>would come again as Lord Kalki/Lord Veera Bhoga Vasantha Raaya to restore dharma and peace on the earth.</li>
<li>And devotees believe that he would rescue them whenever they plead him;</li>
<li>and he will come out from the Jeeva Samadhi when the blood of thousands of people, who beheaded with frustration when the calamities reach peak stage, touches his Jeeva Samadhi.</li>
<li>( It may be noted that like Lord Rama came to earth when Lord Parasurama is still in existence, Lord Veera Bhoga Vasantha Raaya came to earth while both Lord Parasurama and Lord Veera Brahmendra Swamy are still on the earth. )</li>
<li>( The date of Sri Veera Brahmendra Swamy’s coming out from Jeeva Samadhi and of Lord Kalki/LordVeera Bhoga Vasantha Raaya is different).</li>
